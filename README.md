# Data-Visualization-HW5-
Data Bootcamp Week 5 HW on Data Visualization
This assignment was an analysis and visualization on a pharmaceutical drug trial on mice.  There were some duplicate records which required cleaning.  
Overall it was challenging but I'm seeing the applicability of the extra credit work.
I used Xpert Learning and some of the code from office hours and live in class exercises.
